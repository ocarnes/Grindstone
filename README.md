## Overview
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grindstone is a plug-in for the Maya 3D modeling software that will help streamline a team- based 
computer animation production workflow. The workflow of most 3D animation productions is the 
pipeline â€“ essentially an assembly line in which a complete product is assembled as it passes 
through multiple stages of work. The problem that arises in such a process is that occasionally 
objects arrive at a stage either incomplete or with defects that should have been corrected in the 
previous stage. Grindstone aims to solve that problem by sitting between stages of the pipeline and 
ensuring that any object passing from one stage to another is complete and error-free.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Targeting an initial set of errors provided by the UC Denver Digital Animation Center (DAC), 
Grindstone was constructed using the Maya Python API to expose a selection of error-checking and 
error-correcting functionality with the touch of a button. At its core, Grindstone is a script 
deployment platform that allows developers to register their own error-checks/fixes and present 
them to users simply by dropping their scripts in the Grindstone scripts directory. Any groups of 
scripts that apply to the same pipeline stage or technology can be grouped together in a 
subdirectory and presented as a single sequence of scripts through the Grindstone interface.
Although the primary component of this project is the script platform itself, Grindstone currently
contains several scripts that address most of the initial set of errors identified by the DAC.



## Using Grindstone

### How To Access Grindstone In Maya
The production version of Grindstone is automatically loaded into Maya on startup. You can summon the Grindstone interface through a [button](plug-ins/gs_assets/GS_icon.png) on the Custom shelf.
